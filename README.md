3D Generative Wave Art

### Description
A generative art piece I've created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, React-Three-Fiber, and ThreeJs. Having a creative background and the heart of an artist, Ive always dreamt of getting into "Code Art" or "Generative Art". Not only was this project a pursuit of passion, It's process and purpose was to start bulding 3D scenes in WebGL as full react apps.
